# Incentives

The Stakers Union hopes to continue to encourage ecosystem participants to continue to allocate airdrops to home-stakers to support the decentralization of the Ethereum network. However, the Stakers Union is primarily interested in securing sustainable, long-term support for home-stakers through recurring ecosystem grants and funding opportunities (ex. [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/), [Optimism](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf)).

## Airdrops

If you are a member of a project that is developing an airdrop allocation proposal, please [contact us](/contact) to discuss how to best support home-stakers.
