# Initiatives

In addition to securing [incentives](/incentives) for our members, the Stakers Union is also interested in supporting initiatives that support home-stakers.

## Research
Promote discussions and EIP's that preferentially benefit home-stakers over centralized staking solutions.

## Partnerships
Stakers Union members offer high-quality, decentralized validation services that benefit the overall Ethereum ecosystem. Through partnerships with other projects, we can provide similarly decentralized validation services to other projects.
