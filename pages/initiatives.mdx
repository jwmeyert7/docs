# Initiatives

In addition to securing [incentives](/incentives) for our members, the Stakers Union is also interested in supporting initiatives that support home-stakers with a focus on the following areas:
1. **Research**: Promote discussions and EIP's that preferentially benefit home-stakers over centralized staking solutions.
2. **Sustainable Ecosystem Incentives**: Airdrops are generally one-time events which only reward active stakers at the time of the snapshot. We are interested in supporting initiatives that provide ongoing incentives to home-stakers.
