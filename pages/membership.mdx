# Membership

Requirements for membership and verification processes are undergoing active development. We are exploring two options for managing membership.

## Existing Lists

Several community contributors have developed [lists](/membership/existing_lists) of addresses identified as representing solo-stakers. These lists are already-developed but may not necessarily convey commitment to the Stakers Union.

## New List

An alternative would be starting a new list for home-stakers who opt-in to membership. This list would be actively-maintained (ideally on-chain) though would require formalization of a verification process. Maintaining a curated list of active participants would allow the Stakers Union to both offer services (ex. decentralized validation of other services) and distribute incentives to members.
