# Membership

## Eligibility
The Stakers Union prioritizes independent node operators with particular emphasis on those running hardware at home. We recognize that access to stable networking and power is not universal so "remote" stakers (using the [Nixo Classification](https://paragraph.xyz/@ethstaker/define-solo-staker)) are also eligible with a lower multiplier. We exclude "managed" stakers as independent node operation and control over configuration including client selection is a core value of the Stakers Union.

## Participation
Stakers Union membership is an active commitment and inducted members are expected to participate in [initiatives](/initiatives). The Stakers Union will also develop a regular newsletter which may include action items (ex. voting on proposals, calls to modify client selection).

## Maintenance
Members must maintain active validators and high uptime. Stakers Union membership will be reviewed periodically and inactive members may be removed.
