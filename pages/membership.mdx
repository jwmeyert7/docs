# Membership Criteria

There are two preexisting public lists of solo-stakers:

## Rated
Curated by [Rated](https://www.rated.network), supported with a grant from [LEGO](https://lego.lido.fi/). The list is generated based on the following attributes:
1. Solo stakers may have more volatile performance
2. Solo stakers are unlikely to use cloud services
3. Solo stakers funding wallets are used for a variety of purposes and are unlikely to transact programmatically
4. Solo stakers run fewer than 200 validators each

## StakeCat/GLCNI
Curated by [GLCstaked](https://twitter.com/GLCstaked). There are two lists generated by StakeCat which take a more simplistic approach:

### List A
Begin with addresses that have made a valid Beacon Chain deposit and then removing identified entities (ex. Coinbase, Kraken, Lido, Stakewise).

### List B
Similar to List A but further filtered by addresses that have also interacted with smart contracts.
