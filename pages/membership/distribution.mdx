# Distribution

## Calculation

1. Total Multiplier Value: `totalMultiplierValue = Sum(finalMultiplier for each member)`
2. Individual Member Portion: `memberProportion = memberFinalMultiplier / totalMultiplierValue`

## Method

The Stakers Union will use a [Splits](https://splits.org/) contract to distribute funds to members. Members voted to select [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosis.io/) and a contract has been initialized at the following address: [0xd4787AC18b141133ECB1c24ec1f91B5D6c311355](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd4787AC18b141133ECB1c24ec1f91B5D6c311355/?chainId=100). Funds received at alternative associated addresses (ex. [stakersunion.eth](https://app.ens.domains/stakersunion.eth)) will be forwarded to the Splits contract.

## Seasons

Distributions will be made in "seasons" aligning with annual fiscal quarters. Members eligible for distribution must be a verified member for the duration of the season.

### Schedule
