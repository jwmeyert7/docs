# Distribution

## Calculation

1. Total Multiplier Value: `totalMultiplierValue = Sum(finalMultiplier for each member)`
2. Individual Member Portion: `memberProportion = memberFinalMultiplier / totalMultiplierValue`

## Method

The Stakers Union will use a [Splits](https://splits.org/) contract to distribute funds to members. Members voted to select [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosis.io/) and a contract has been initialized at the following address: [0xd4787AC18b141133ECB1c24ec1f91B5D6c311355](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd4787AC18b141133ECB1c24ec1f91B5D6c311355/?chainId=100).

Funds are requested to [stakersunion.eth](https://app.ens.domains/stakersunion.eth) which is managed by a multisig with the following members:

1. [stakersunion](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1c125e5cD5f4f7B473cb59C999f82B2583C4459)
