# Verification

The Stakers Union employs a comprehensive verification process to ensure the integrity of its membership lists. The process includes several steps detailed below:

<Steps>

### Proof of Eligibility

Submission of a signed oath from an eligible validator deposit or withdrawal address. The address must be present on [StakeCat List A](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers/blob/main/Solo-Stakers/Solo-Stakers-A.csv) or an accepted [appeal](/membership/appeals). Instructions for signing messages are available [here](/membership/verification/signing).

#### Oath

```text copy
Night gathers, and now my stake begins.
It shall not end until my final block.
I shall hold no memes, bear no greed and claim no fame.
I shall live and die at my node.
I am the validator in the shadows.
I am the watcher on the chains.
I am the shield that guards against corruption, the fire that fuels the network, the light that maintains transparency, the horn that calls to the honest.
I pledge my code and commitment to Ethereum, for this epoch and all the epochs to come.
```

### Proof of Independent Operation

After submission of the signed message, prospective members must prove independent operation of their validator. Prospective members will receive a set of dates/times from which they will select one time period to disable attestations (two consecutive attestations). This action proves the validator is under the control of the prospective member.

### Proof of Residential Operation

An optional step to prove residential operation and access to additional multipliers. On the date selected for proof of independent operation, prospective members must submit a photo of their node with the following requirements:
1. The hardware should be clearly visible.
2. An international newspaper front page or a printout of a news website must be included, with the text "Stakers Union" visibly written on it.
