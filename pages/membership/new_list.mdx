# New List

An alternative to using existing lists (generated based on heuristics) is to start a new list of opt-in members.

## Advantages
1. Allows the Stakers Union to curate willing and active participants.
2. Directly maintain the list without relying on third-parties.
3. Support coordination of member activity (ex. decentralized validation of other services).

## Challenges
1. Developing a formalized verfication process.
2. Creating and maintaining an on-chain list.
3. Ensuring widespread distribution of application process to ensure inclusivity.
4. Developing smart contracts to distribute incentives.
