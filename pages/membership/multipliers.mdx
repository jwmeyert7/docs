# Multipliers

Some home-stakers may be granted multipliers based on a demonstration of a commitment to the network. The following are some examples:

1. **Genesis**: Home-stakers who have been staking since the genesis of the Beacon Chain. These stakers helped Ethereum reach the minimum stake required to launch the Beacon Chain.
2. **Pre-Merge**: These home-stakers deposited their ETH knowing they would be unable to withdraw.
3. **Performance**: Home-stakers who maintained high uptime and performance.
4. **Testnet**: Home-stakers who participated in testnets.
