# Signing a Message

Membership in the Stakers Union requires verification of signed messages from deposit or withdrawal addresses associated with your validators.

## Etherscan Verified Signatures
Etherscan provides a [simple interface](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures) for signing an arbitrary text message (the Stakers Union [Oath](/membership/verification#oath) in this case). The interface allows for connections to hardware wallets through MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Coinbase Wallet.

## Offline Signing
For those who prefer to sign messages offline, options include:
1. [MyCrypto](https://download.mycrypto.com/)
2. [ethdo](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo)
