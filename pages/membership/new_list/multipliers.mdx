# Multipliers

The Stakers Union prioritizes independent/decentralized node operation, performance and commitment to the Ethereum network. These values are reflected in multipliers that determine the distribution of incentives.

## Independent Node Operation

| Location | Multiplier |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Home     | 1          |
| Remote   | 0.75       |

## Performance

| Metric                                                        | Multiplier |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Block Proposals**                                           |            |
| Percent Block Proposals &gt;95%<br /> (or zero scheduled)     | 1          |
| Percent Block Proposals 51-94%                                | 0.75       |
| Percent Block Proposals &lt;50%                               | 0.5        |
| **Attestations**                                              |            |
| Percent Attestations &ht;95%                                  | 1          |
| Percent Attestations 51-94%                                   | 0.75       |
| Percent Attestations &lt;50%                                  | 0.5        |
| **Sync Participation**                                        |            |
| Percent Sync Participation &gt;95% <br /> (or zero scheduled) | 1          |
| Percent Sync Participation 51-94%                             | 0.75       |
| Percent Sync Participation &lt;50%                            | 0.5        |

## Commitment

| Stage[^1]  | Multiplier |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Genesis    | 1.5        |
| Pre-Merge  | 1.25       |
| Post-Merge | 1          |

## Multiplier Calculation
```text
Final Multiplier = Independent Node Operation Multiplier * Average Performance Multiplier * Commitment Multiplier
```

## Example
For a pre-merge home node with 1/2 block proposals, >99% attestations and >99% sync participation:
* Independent Node Operation Multiplier = ```1```
* Average Performance Multiplier = ```(0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83```
* Commitment Multiplier = ```1.25```

```text
Final Multiplier = 1 * 0.83 * 1.25 = 1.03
```
