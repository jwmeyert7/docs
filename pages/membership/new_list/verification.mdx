# Verification

## Proof of Address

Submission of a signed oath from an eligible validator deposit or withdrawal address. The address must be present on an [existing list](/membership/existing_lists) or an accepted [appeal](/membership/existing_lists/appeals). Some options for signing messages can be found [here](/membership/new_list/verification/signing).

### Oath

```text copy
Night gathers, and now my stake begins.
It shall not end until my final block.
I shall hold no memes, bear no greed and claim no fame.
I shall live and die at my node.
I am the validator in the shadows.
I am the watcher on the chains.
I am the shield that guards against corruption, the fire that fuels the network, the light that maintains transparency, the horn that calls to the honest.
I pledge my code and commitment to Ethereum, for this epoch and all the epochs to come.
```
