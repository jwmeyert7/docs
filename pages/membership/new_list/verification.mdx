# Verification

Verification of independent node operation is challenging. Current proposals include:

1. **Proof of Address:** Submission of a predetermined signed message from an eligible validator deposit or withdrawal address. The address must be present on an [existing list](/membership/existing_lists) or an accepted [appeal](/membership/existing_lists/appeals).

2. **Proof of Independent Operation:** Participation in a video call with a Stakers Union representative demonstrating independent operation.
