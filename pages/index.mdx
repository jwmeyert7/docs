# Stakers Union

Welcome to the Stakers Union. We are a collective of home-stakers securing the Ethereum network.

## The Problem

Incentives for home-stakers are dwindling. Liquid staking and restaking protocols and their associated liquid tokens drive many away from home-staking.

## Objectives

1. Support the Ethereum network by maintaining the decentralization of validators
2. Build and maintain a comprehensive and reliable list of home-stakers interested in participation
3. Establish connections with ecosystem participants who are interested in supporting this public good
4. Secure stable, long-term incentives to encourage home-staking

## Next Steps
Expand the community and develop a comprehensive proposal with the following key components:
- [ ] Define membership qualifications
- [ ] Determine verification process
- [ ] Identify and communicate with interested ecosystem participants
- [ ] Develop distribution process (performance, vesting)
