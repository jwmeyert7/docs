# Stakers Union

Welcome to the Stakers Union. We are a collective of home-stakers securing the Ethereum network.

## The Problem

Incentives for home-stakers are dwindling. Liquid staking and restaking protocols and their associated liquid tokens drive many away from home-staking.

## Objectives

1. Build and maintain a comprehensive and reliable list of home-stakers interested in particiopation
2. Establish connections with ecosystem participants who are interested in supporting this public good
3. Secure stable, long-term incentives to encourage home-staking

## Next Steps
Expand the community and develop a comprehensive proposal with the following key components:
1. Define membership qualifications
2. Determine verification process
3. Identify and communicate with interested ecosystem participants
4. Develop distribution process (performance, vesting)
