# Stakers Union

Welcome to the Stakers Union. We are a collective of home-stakers securing the Ethereum network.

## The Problem

Solo stakers are the backbone of the core value proposition (decentralized, censorship resistant) of the Ethereum network but liquid staking and restaking protocols and their associated liquid tokens benefit from economy of scale in ways that solo stakers have trouble competing with. These often-centralized, well-capitalized protocols have abundant means to advocate for themselves whereas solo stakers are, by design, decentralized, disorganized, and difficult to identify. Maximizing consideration for solo stakers in protocol design and in external rewards flow is key in making sure the network retains its existing solo stakers and attracts new ones to maintain Ethereum's core value prop

## Objectives

1. Support the Ethereum network by maintaining the decentralization of validators
2. Build and maintain a comprehensive and reliable list of home-stakers interested in participation
3. Establish connections with ecosystem participants who are interested in supporting this public good
4. Secure stable, long-term incentives to encourage home-staking

## Next Steps
Expand the community and develop a comprehensive proposal with the following key components:
- [ ] Define membership qualifications
- [ ] Determine verification process
- [ ] Identify and communicate with interested ecosystem participants
- [ ] Develop distribution process (performance, vesting)
